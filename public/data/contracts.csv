The value of the contract is approximately £140,000 per annum. Pontarddulais Comprehensive School is an English medium 11-16 mixed school in the City and County of Swansea. There are currently 850 pupils on roll. The School was opened in 1982, with a Specialist Teaching Facility added in 2007 for up to 10 pupils with profound and multiple learning disabilities. It serves a large catchment area that includes Llangyfelach, Pengelli, Pontarddulais, Pontlliw and Penllergaer primary schools. Pupils are drawn from a widely dispersed catchment area including urban areas, small villages and hill farms. A significant demand for places outside the designated catchment confirms the popularity of the school.The School has sustained a record of excellent performance in pupil outcomes over several years. The School received a hugely positive Estyn inspection in December 2023. It was noted that ""Pontarddulais Comprehensive School is a dynamic and inclusive school where pupils, regardless of background or ability, thrive academically, socially, and emotionally”.The school places great value on their partnerships with parents and carers. They believe that pupils’ success is founded on forging positive relationships through mutual respect, and excellent teaching and learning experiences.The motto for the school is ""Learn to live, Live to learn"". This reflects the school's philosophy of nurturing successful learners who have a lifelong love of learning and grow into confident, resilient, and caring individuals.The school prides itself on its team ethos and would see the cleaning contractor as part of the wider team. They are community focussed and take time to forge relationships between staff and pupils and those teams they work with. They would want the cleaning contractor to forge relationships with staff and take pride in the building itself.The fabric of the building is the same as it was when it opened in 1982 so it is tired in appearance and can cause a challenge to keep looking up to standard. There is a Specialist Teaching Facility as part of the school site with pupils who have profound and multiple learning difficulties. This unit in particular, requires a high level of cleaning due to pupils higher risk of infection.The school is a busy and thriving environment that will require cleaning contractors to be flexible to fit around events that take place in the building.The duration of the contract being offered is three years commencing on 1st April 2026 and concluding on 31st March 2029 and will be on a guaranteed performance basis offering a fixed annual subsidy to the school. There will be the option to extend the contract for a further term further term of three years.

Preliminary Market Engagement (PME) allows local authorities and other contracting authorities in the public sector to engage with a market. PME is designed to encourage the commercial and voluntary sectors to engage with the development process before a procurement is released. This is the market’s opportunity to express its views, outline market developments and generally influence how solutions to the Authority’s needs might be met. There is nothing for the Authority to evaluate or select in this activity. PME is not a call for competition. Following PME, the Authority may conclude that procurement is not the best solution to meet a particular strategy outcome. The Authority may conclude that it would be better to do something entirely different to the intent within this PME. It is essential that any organisation participating in the PME understands that a procurement opportunity is not guaranteed. It is therefore essential that organisations understand that this activity is not part of a procurement exercise and involvement in the PME does not affect an organisation’s positioning either positively or negatively should a procurement opportunity arise subsequently. The Authority may release a PME to: • Share information to inform the market of an impending procurement, such that they might make preparations for the tender when it is released; and • Gather information to develop the Authority’s strategy. We therefore recommend that if there is no intent to engage in the PME, it is better to sustain interest in activity on YORtender to ensure that any interested party remains informed.","United Kingdom","","","","","","https://app.stotles.com/records/b0e93333-6639-4c81-b787-e56c802b00d0",,"","","","",""

One (1) Focused Ion Beam–Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) This procurement will establish a nationally significant microscopy capability for Ireland, strengthening Tyndall’s leadership in semiconductor, photonic, and quantum materials research and supporting long-term collaboration with academic and industrial stakeholders. The TEM Suite will deliver sustained scientific, technological, and economic impact through enhanced analytical capability, research excellence, and innovation at the nanoscale. This investment will expand and modernise Tyndall’s capability in advanced materials and device characterisation to meet the requirements of its national and international research programmes, including activities under the EU Chips Act and strategic collaborations with academic and industrial partners. The TEM Suite will form a key component of the new Tyndall laboratory facilities currently under development and will support Tyndall’s mission to provide world-leading infrastructure for semiconductor, photonic, and quantum technologies. The Aberration-corrected and monochromated TEM will represent the highest-performance instrument within the suite. It must deliver sub-ångström imaging resolution and high-energy-resolution spectroscopy, providing the capability to study interfaces, defects, and nanostructures at the atomic scale. The system must support advanced analytical and imaging modes, including low-dose operation for beam-sensitive materials, Lorentz and 4D-STEM imaging, and in-situ experimentation (electrical, thermal, and environmental). Automated alignment, optical stability, and full integration with advanced camera, detector, and control software are essential to ensure repeatable and high-quality data generation across multiple users. The 200 kV high-throughput TEM capable of atomic resolution imaging will provide a complementary, multi-user analytical capability to support daily research operations and routine analysis. It must combine high brightness and excellent spatial resolution with rapid operational stability, user-friendly alignment, and automated workflow functionality. This instrument will be optimised for versatility and efficiency, ensuring broad accessibility for internal and collaborative research, training, and industry engagement activities. The FIB-SEM will enable site-specific sample preparation, 3D structural analysis, and nanoscale milling to support both TEM systems. It must achieve high-resolution imaging and precision ion-beam milling for lamella production and cross-sectional analysis. Integration with the TEM workflows is required to ensure seamless specimen transfer and preparation from wafer-scale structures to atomic-scale analysis. This tender is being issued as a single integrated suite rather than as separate tools to ensure technical, operational, and economic coherence across all instruments. Procuring the TEMs and FIB-SEM from a single manufacturer will enable a shared control software platform, providing a consistent user interface and operational framework across the suite. This is important in Tyndall’s multi-user research and training environment, for staff, postgraduate students, and industry partners, as it simplifies training, improves safety, and promotes efficient use of laboratory time. A unified suite will also allow for the interchange of sample holders and accessories, enabling seamless workflow integration from sample preparation to atomic-scale imaging. A single-supplier arrangement provides additional benefits including simplified warranty and maintenance agreements, harmonised service schedules, and a single point of technical contact.","Ireland",5500000,"EUR","","","","https://app.stotles.com/records/416ab6ee-a92a-4ec1-873a-d93d4635e183",,"","University College Cork","+353 21 4903514","procurement@ucc.ie",""

This ongoing degradation compromises the resilience of these systems, making them more vulnerable to acute shocks like marine heat waves and spills, as well as chronic stresses such as wind farm construction. The decline in ecosystem health not only threatens fisheries and other livelihoods but also hampers our capacity for carbon absorption. To effectively manage and mitigate these challenges, there is an ever-increasing demand for cost-effective and targeted environmental monitoring. Modern technologies, including drones, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (AI), are proving invaluable in enhancing monitoring capabilities while reducing the need for intensive human involvement.However, traditional visible light surveys of benthic and coastal habitats offer limited insights into the identification of flora, fauna, and pollution. In response to these limitations, there is a growing adoption of hyperspectral imagery. This technology captures significant amounts of data beyond the visible light revealing new environmental detail, surpassing the capabilities of visible light or human monitoring.Cefas requires a sensor to develop and extend its monitoring capability for coastal and benthic environments. Hyperspectral imaging is required to detect and characterise flora and fauna on land (seaweed on rocks, on beach), sea surface (plankton, algae) and underwater (benthic epifauna and flora). In addition, ideally the sensor would allow us to detect pollutants such as plastics that are characterized more in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) range of spectrum. The sensor will support near‑term pilot pipelines for: (a) benthic habitat surveys (via Cefas custom built housing) and (b) aerial shoreline surveys for plastic detection, while providing a flexible platform for future applications.Scope of Requirements:Technical RequirementThe Supplier will provide a complete hyperspectral infrared imaging solution suitable for both Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operation and laboratory use, including all necessary hardware, lenses, software and accessories required to acquire, calibrate, process and export orthorectified hyperspectral data cubes.At a minimum, the proposed system will be capable of capturing data across the Very Near Infrared (VNIR) spectral range (400–1000 nm). Ideally, a drone-mountable solution would extend coverage to include VNIR, Near Infrared (NIR), and as much of the SWIR range as feasible—targeting a full spectral span of approximately 400–2700 nm.Cefas understand that drone-compatible SWIR sensors may exceed the maximum available budget (£130,000 inc. VAT). Therefore, a hybrid approach of a drone-mounted VNIR sensor, complemented by a laboratory-based (non-flyable) SWIR system is an acceptable solution. Cefas is open to alternative configurations if the Supplier can propose a more suitable option that meets the technical requirements and stays within budget.In addition, the Supplier will provide comprehensive training on implementing data processing pipelines for hyperspectral data collected from the sensor, as well as operational support for Cefas drone pilots. This support will include training sessions covering environmental conditions, target selection, and sensor configuration to ensure optimal data collection Clear documentation of all data collection and processing steps are essential.","United Kingdom",92000,"GBP","","","","https://app.stotles.com/records/e97aff34-df5a-4b73-bb72-d38947dc3395",,"","","","procure@cefas.gov.uk",""

This assessment underscored the necessity for appointing a qualified service provider who can support the Council’s evolving waste management strategy, particularly in enhancing recycling rates across its operational estate and reducing Scope 3 emissions associated with staff and leisure facilities. As such, MBC has been assessing the Council’s waste output on a monthly basis, generating internal and external actions to assess weights and volumes of general waste versus recycling streams. Tenderers are expected to offer this service in the form of a report, alongside general key performance indicators.It should be noted that certain locations are excluded from this contract, including parks, public litter collections, industrial units, and properties under full leasehold arrangements.The Council’s current waste management contract is due to expire in February 2026. MBC is therefore seeking to procure a long-term solution through this tender process, with the objective of ensuring a seamless transition and continuity of service, without any interruption to collections. Furthermore, MBC will be undertaking a significant refurbishment of its main office premises- Maidstone House and The Link (MBC01)- in spring 2026, which will involve a phased programme of floor closures between May- December 2026 (final dates subject to final programme by Main Contractor). It is imperative that prospective suppliers demonstrate flexibility and adaptability in service delivery throughout the contract term, as the Council reserves the right to amend the scope of services in response to operational requirements.

Government (Sláintecare Report), departmental (Digital for Care 2030), and organisational strategy (HSE Corporate Plan 2025-2027), respectively note the potential to expand the use of telehealth services as a key mechanism to enable care delivery closer to home, earlier discharge from secondary care services, and to enhance access to services for patients and families. Remote health monitoring has emerged as a viable clinical tool, that is a safe and efficient alternative to care provision in conventional clinical settings. Remote health monitoring technologies facilitate the provision of safe care that allows clinicians to remotely monitor the vital signs, physical symptoms, chronic conditions, and patient feedback of suitable patients thus supporting the receipt of the care, monitoring, and treatment they need from where they call home. Clinical pathways incorporating remote health monitoring enables, but is not limited to, (i) care delivered remotely by a multidisciplinary team if clinically appropriate and with clear lines of clinical responsibility and governance, (ii) chronic disease management in the community, (iii) the avoidance of hospital admission/attendance, and/or early hospital discharge, and (iv) increased service capacity and efficiency without additional physical clinical setting development. A core objective in expanding the use of remote health monitoring technologies is to assist in the provision of clinical care remotely in a coordinated and integrated way. This approach will increase the capacity of the health service to manage patient care without additional physical clinical setting development, and improve the efficiency of service delivery. This procurement process is on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE) including all Regional Health Areas and organisations fully or partly funded by the HSE, in addition to other publicly funded agencies. The HSE is seeking to procure an effective and market proven end-to-end, fully vendor managed solution with a Single Supplier, which is ready for immediate deployment. This solution will encompass, but is not limited to, the provision and support of a suite of web-based application(s) and clinical measurement equipment, the logistical management of platform(s) and associated devices, support for implementations, and maintenance and decontamination of associated devices.

PACE is in the process of onboarding a cohort of projects into its portfolio from its 2024 Diagnostics Funding Round and by November expects to have onboarded between 4-6 early stage (TRL2-5) projects seeking to advance AMR diagnostics that have potential to reduce unnecessary prescribing, provide faster results to indicate which antibiotic should be used and/or catalyse the move to personalised, narrow-spectrum treatments. Projects are developing diagnostic solutions for urinary tract, lower respiratory tract and blood stream (including sepsis) infections.The PACE programme is looking for an external provider to deliver an ‘Enabling Project’ in partnership related to early health economic analysis to support our cohort of AMR diagnostic innovation developers from our 2nd PACE funding call. Please see (https://paceamr.org.uk/news/ukhsa-announced-as-first-pace-collaboration-to-help-tackle-deadly-antimicrobial-resistance/) for details of our first enabling project partnering with UKHSA to provide access to clinical isolates for our first cohort of therapeutics developers.The overall purpose of this second enabling project is to provide PACE awardees and the wider AMR community with access to practical early-stage health economic outputs, including care pathway insights, indicative cost analyses, early-stage economic modelling and value proposition frameworks tailored to our cohorts emerging diagnostic technologies. These outputs will be designed to support product development decisions, stakeholder engagements and future reimbursement planning with relevance across bloodstream infections (BSI), respiratory tract infections (RTI) and urinary tract infections.Keywords:PACE","United Kingdom","","","","","","https://app.stotles.com/records/a084b8fc-f399-447b-aeb4-af48452cd8ba",,"","James Tomlinson","+441625708394","[email protected]",""

Increased footfall during peak seasons is often reflected in an increased seasonal demand for temporary staff, whereas business as usual demands (eg to cover sickness or roster gaps) can fluctuate throughout the year, requiring a responsive temporary workforce that can flex with our needs.  These temporary staff are specifically required to support with the following functions/roles:•Gateline•Station Assistance•General Customer Service•Events•Projects/PossessionsRole Profiles will be shared during the tender exercise.ObjectivesThe temporary labour contract must ensure continuity of operations, provide support for special events and meet project deadlines by supplementing the permanent GWR workforce with qualified temporary personnel.Flexibility and responsiveness is essential to enable fulfilment of short-notice requests for either single shifts or longer-term cover, and proactive forecasting and modelling is required to ensure good coverage for pre-planned special events and projects/possessions across the network.  Scope of ServicesServices will be requested as required, with forecasting and modelling taking place where possible, but with short-term requests required to ensure good coverage of business as usual operations. Job roles required are Gateline, Station Assistance, general customer service, and support during events or projects/possessions.The number of personnel required to support with the GWR operation may vary significantly but is estimated to be between 10,000-15,000 hours per quarter (based on 2024/25 figures). Expected working hours could fall anywhere between 06:00-23:00 (dependent on region, station and role), and shifts should generally be between 7 and 10 hours in duration. Temporary labour assignments, particularly ad hoc requests, could be located at any station across the GWR network, see GWR Route Map in the Appendix. Stations that annually have special events and will require a volume of forecasted support include Cheltenham Spa, Bath Spa, Henley-on-Thames, Reading, Castle Cary and Newquay.The duration of engagement could vary significantly, based on the role, location and reason for request. For short-notice sickness cover the requirement could be for just one or two shifts. Longer-term sickness coverage, or support with filling a roster due to other absence, could mean an engagement of many weeks or even months. A special event or possession, dependent on scale and duration, could require a booking of three or four consecutive shifts, up to a few weeks or even longer. Temporary labour support at GWR is often required more at weekends (particularly Sunday) than during the week, so the labour provider should note that coverage of weekend shifts is a key requirement.

The basic requirement is for a Customer Relationship Management System built on Microsoft Dynamics within the Irish Red Cross Microsoft 365 Tenant. The proposed solution must: ● Provide a centralised, secure database for all supporter types. ● Automate and streamline workflows across departments. ● Enable volunteer self-service for registration, training and availability. ● Improve oversight of local activities and branch coordination. ● Enhance donor and volunteer engagement through personalised journeys. ● Support training and event management with integration to Moodle. ● Enable data-driven decision-making through real-time reporting and analytics. In general, delivery is expected to be phased, with an initial focus on developing a Minimum Viable Product that can then be iteratively developed over the duration of the contract. Specifically, the CRM should fulfil the following objectives: 1. Centralised Database Management Establish a secure, centralised database to manage comprehensive records of volunteers, members, training participants and donors. This will eliminate duplication, improve data accuracy and support efficient access to up-to-date information across all organisational levels. 2. Automation and Streamlining of Processes Replace current manual and fragmented workflows with automated, integrated processes across registration, onboarding, training, renewals and reporting. This will improve internal efficiencies, reduce administrative burden and minimise delays - especially during times of high demand or crisis response. 3. Volunteer Self-Service Functionality Enable volunteers to access a self-service portal where they can: o Register and update personal information o Track and log volunteer hours o Register for training and events o View eligibility for roles or advanced training based on participation 4. Oversight and Coordination of Local Activities Provide real-time visibility into local branch activities and volunteer engagement levels, allowing national and regional staff to better support, coordinate and align activities across the organisation. 5. Enhanced Volunteer and Donor Engagement Facilitate more efficient and personalised communication through the creation of tailored volunteer and donor engagement journeys. The CRM should support segmentation, scheduling, and tracking of communications and interactions to build stronger relationships and increase retention. 6. Training and Event Management Enable effective planning, delivery, and tracking of training and events, including demand analysis by location and prerequisites such as volunteer qualifications. This will support strategic training delivery and resource allocation. 7. Data-Driven Decision Making Provide real-time dashboards, analytics, and reporting capabilities to allow evidence-based decision-making, impact measurement, and proactive engagement at local and national levels.
